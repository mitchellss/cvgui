This project uses a 
[hexagonal architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagonal_architecture_(software)) 
(also called "ports and adapters" architecture)
such that it can more easily support a varied array of inputs, graphical
outputs, and feedback devices. Core business logic is stored in
sub-packages under the `core` package. These include:
- `displaying`: Interfaces and logic for displaying data
- `providing_feedback`: Interfaces and logic for providing feedback to user
- `recieving`: Interfaces and logic for data input
<!-- - `logging`: Interfaces and logic for logging  -->

The interfaces ("Protocols" in Python) in these core packages define
"ports", or standards that need to be met in order to interact with the 
program. By implementing these interfaces, concrete classes create 
"adapters" that allow them to "plug in" to the project. 

The rest of the packages under `cvgui` provide adapters to the ports
defined in `core`. For instance, the `user_interface` package provides
graphical user interface implementations that conform to the `displaying`
core package port (found under `core/displaying/service.py`).
